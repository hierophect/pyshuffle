# Cards
## ch-1
english;chinese;~pinyin
// example: I am Chinese
// 我是中国人
// Note that the exchanges immediately get tricky!
// what do we put in for "shi"? is, am, and are can't be interchanged in english
// two approaches:
I am [nationality];我是[nationality];Wǒ shì [nationality]
[they-you] are [nationality];[they-you]是[nationality];[they-you] shì [nationality]
[he-she] is [nationality];[he-she]是[nationality];[he-she] shì [nationality]
// or
[person-assignment-being] [nationality];[person-assignment-being][nationality];[person-assignment-being] [nationality]
// or maybe something like this? (not implemented, just brainstorming)
//[person#link] [assignment-verb#link] [nationality]

// example: I am listening to a song
// 我在听歌
// This is where we need something called a "pair group", something that links two words together
// You can eat an apple, or listen to a song, but you can't eat a song.
// I haven't implemented pair groups yet so we have to make a whole sentence per verb. Lame!
I am listening to a [listenable-thing];我在听[listenable-thing];Wǒ zài tīng [listenable-thing]
[person-assignment-verbing] listening to a [listenable-thing];[person-assignment-verbing]听[listenable-thing];[person-assignment-verbing] tīng [listenable-thing]
[person-assignment-verbing] eating [edible-thing]s;[person-assignment-verbing]吃[edible-thing];[person-assignment-verbing] chī [edible-thing]
